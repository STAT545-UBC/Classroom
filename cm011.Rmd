# Advanced R programming

__WARNING: content subject to change__

## Review, and Looking Ahead

We're done with the "core concepts" of data wrangling and data vis, both of which are fundamental to exploratory data analysis (EDA). 

Now, we're starting more "specialized" topics for EDA.

## Today's Lessons

Today's class is on R programming. 

When we first saw R:

- we made a script to compute the variance of commute times.
- we saw that R can handle more than just numbers -- it can also handle things like characters and logicals.

Today, we'll aim to cover the following topics (which we'll call Part I):

- "Flavours" of R objects
- Vectors, vectorization, and recycling.
- Lists

If time remains, we'll move on to Part II:

- Environments and Scoping

## Resources

Part I:

- Jenny's [Basic R Objects](http://stat545.com/block004_basic-r-objects.html) tutorial covers Part I. 
- A more thorough treatment of the topic can be found in [adv-r: Data Structures](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html) and [adv-r: Subsetting](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Subsetting.html).

Part II:

- [adv-r: Functions: Lexical Scoping section](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functions.html#lexical-scoping) 
- [adv-r: Environments](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Environments.html): "Environment Basics" section, and "Function Environments" section (but don't worry about "binding environments" and "calling environments").
