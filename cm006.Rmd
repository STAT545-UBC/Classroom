# Class Meeting 06: Introduction to plotting with `ggplot2`

--- LAST YEAR'S CONTENT BELOW ---


## Announcements

- No break today.

## Today's Lessons

Today's lessons are:

- Orientation to statistical graphics
- The grammar of graphics
- Plotting with `x` and `y` aesthetics

## Resources

Concepts from today's class (and next class) are closely mirrored by the following resources, which introduce `ggplot2`, although are organized in different ways for each.

The following are good walk-throughs that introduce `ggplot2`:

- [r4ds: data-vis](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) chapter.
    - Perhaps the most compact "walk-through" style resource.
- The [ggplot2 book](http://webcat2.library.ubc.ca/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=8489511), Chapter 2.
    - A bit more comprehensive "walk-through" style resource.
    - Section 1.2 introduces the actual grammar components. 

Here are some other resources you might find useful:

- [Jenny's ggplot2 tutorial](https://github.com/jennybc/ggplot2-tutorial).
    - Has a lot of examples, but less dialogue.
- [R Graphics Cookbook](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/)
    - Good as a reference if you want to learn how to make a specific type of plot.
- [`ggplot2` cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)

## Participation

To get participation points for today, we'll be filling out the [cm006-exercise.Rmd](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/blob/master/notes/cm006-exercise.Rmd) file, and adding it to your participation repo. 

Let's get set up:

1. To download the file the easy way, just click the upper-right drop-down menu [of the html version](http://stat545.com/Classroom/notes/cm006-exercise.nb.html) of the file.
2. Download the `.Rmd` version to your local participation repo.
3. Open the `.Rmd` file, and change the output type to `html_document`, keeping the `.md` file, too.
4. _Optional, but recommended_: Stage and commit the Rmd file (you can do this through RStudio).
    - You can still get participation marks by uploading the final files to GitHub.

# Orientation to statistical graphics

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students are expected to be able to:

- Identify the plotting framework available in R
- Have a sense of why we're learning the `ggplot2` tool
- Have a sense of the importance of statistical graphics in communicating information

## Discussion

There are three main ways you can produce graphics in R. In order of inception, they are

- base R
- `lattice` (an R package)
- `ggplot2` (an R package)
    - Part of the `tidyverse`

Why `ggplot2`?

- once fluent, can make most plots up to publication quality standard very quickly.
- has theoretical underpinning in the "layered grammar of graphics", which is described in [the book by Leland Wilkinson](http://resolve.library.ubc.ca/cgi-bin/catsearch?bid=5507286 ).

Stackoverflow was my main source of learning. Google what you're trying to do, and persevere. You can do it.

[Jenny Bryan on statistical graphics](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/ggplot2-tutorial?slide=7):

- A picture is worth 1000 words
- More philosophy on graphics
- Comparing base R/lattice/ggplot2
- The learning curve

# The grammar of graphics

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students are expected to be able to:

- Identify the seven components of the grammar of graphics underlying `ggplot2`
- Have a sense of what the seven components are

## Discussion

Leland Wilkinson lays out the grammar of graphics [in his book](http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387245447).

They define the "space of statistical graphics".

The grammar components, adapted to `ggplot2` (gg = grammar of graphics), where the __bold__ ones are necessary to specify for every plot:

- __Data__
- __Aesthetic mappings__
- __Geometric objects__
- Scales
- Statistical transformations
- Coordinate system
- Facet specification


# Plotting with `x` and `y` aesthetics

## Learning Objectives

This live-coding-based lesson focusses on: 

- using the `x` and `y` aesthetic mappings, while
- using different geometric objects to explore various plot "types".

By the end of this lesson, students are expected to be able to:

- Create a variety of "plot types" using `ggplot2` under the following situations:
    - two numeric variables
    - one numeric variable
    - one numeric, one categorical variable

## Demonstration

Note: We'll be jumping straight into the `ggplot()` function, instead of the more limited `qplot()` function.

Follow along with the [`cm006-exercise.Rmd`](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/blob/master/notes/cm006-exercise.Rmd) file we downloaded earlier.
