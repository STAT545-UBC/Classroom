# Intro to data wrangling, Part I


## Today's Lessons

Today we'll introduce the [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) package. Specifically, we'll look at these three lessons:

- Intro to `dplyr` syntax
- The `dplyr` advantage
- Relational/comparison and logical operators in R

## Resources

All three of today's lessons are closely aligned to the [stat545: dplyr-intro](http://stat545.com/block009_dplyr-intro.html).

More detail can be found in the [r4ds: transform](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html) chapter, up until and including the `select()` section. Section 5.2 also elaborates on relational/comparison and logical operators in R

Here are some supplementary resources:

- A similar resource to the r4ds one above is the [intro to dplyr vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html), up until and including the `select()` section.
- Want to read more about piping? See [r4ds: pipes](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html).

## Participation

To get participation points for today, we'll be filling out the [cm006-exercise.Rmd](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/blob/master/tutorials/cm006-exercise.Rmd) file, and adding it to your participation repo.

Let's get set up:

1. Click the upper-right drop-down menu [of the html version](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/blob/master/tutorials/cm006-exercise.nb.html).
2. Download the `.Rmd` version to your local participation repo.
    - You should have it cloned to your local machine (aka your computer) from last time.
3. _Optional, but recommended_: Stage and commit the Rmd file (you can do this through RStudio).
    - You can still get participation marks by uploading the final files to GitHub.

## Intro to `dplyr` syntax

### Learning Objectives

Here are the concepts we'll be exploring in this lesson:

- tidyverse
- `dplyr` functions:
    - select
    - arrange
- piping

By the end of this lesson, students are expected to be able to:

- subset and rearrange data with `dplyr`
- use piping (`%>%`) when implementing function chains

### Preamble

Let's talk about:

- The history of `dplyr`: `plyr`
- tibbles are a special type of data frame
- the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)

### Demonstration

Let's get started with the exercise:

1. Open RStudio, and download the `tidyverse` meta-package by executing `install.packages("tidyverse")` into the R console.
2. _Optional_: open the `STAT545_participation` RStudio project in RStudio.
3. With RStudio, open the `cm006-exercise.Rmd` file you downloaded and committed earlier.
4. Follow the instructions in the `.Rmd` file until the *resume lecture* section.

## The `dplyr` advantage

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students are expected to be able to:

- Have a sense of why `dplyr` is advantageous compared to the "base R" way with respect to good coding practice.

Why?

- Having this in the back of your mind will help you identify qualities of and produce a readable analysis.

### Compare base R to `dplyr`

__Self-documenting code__. 

This is where the tidyverse shines.

Example of `dplyr` vs base R:

```
gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Cambodia") %>%
  select(year, lifeExp)
```

vs.

```
gapminder[gapminder$country == "Cambodia", c("year", "lifeExp")]
```

__No need to take excerpts__.

Wrangle with `dplyr` first, then pipe into a plot/analysis.

OR, use the `subset` argument that's often offered by R functions like `lm()`.

Especially don't use magic numbers to subset!

Note that you need to use the assignment operator to store changes!

## Small break

Here are some things you might choose to do on this break:

- Talk with a TA, Vincenzo, or your neighbour(s) about the content so far.
- Fill out the challenge on the `cm006-exercise.Rmd` file.
- Work on an assignment.

## Relational/Comparison and Logical Operators in R

### Learning Objectives

Here are the concepts we'll be exploring in this lesson:

- Relational/Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- `dplyr` functions:
    - filter
    - mutate

By the end of this lesson, students are expected to be able to:

- Predict the output of R code containing the above operators.
- Explain the difference between `&`/`&&` and `|`/`||`, and name a situation where one should be used over the other.
- Subsetting and transforming data using filter and mutate

### Demonstration

Continue along with the `cm006-exercise.Rmd` file. 

## If there's time remaining

1. Let's do the bonus exercises together, in the `cm006-exercise.Rmd` file.
2. Another "break"
