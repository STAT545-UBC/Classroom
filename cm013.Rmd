# Class Meeting 13

--- LAST YEAR'S CONTENT BELOW ---

Today: various plotting topics.

Worksheet: 

- [Rmd](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/blob/master/notes/cm013-exercise.Rmd), 
- [from html](http://stat545.com/Classroom/notes/cm013-exercise.nb.html)

If we finish the worksheet before the end of class:

1. What makes a plot "publication quality"? Give examples.
2. What is plotting _effectiveness_?
    - How well the plot conveys the info contained in the data. 
    - Impossible to perfect! Hence figure captions.
    - Mantra from Gelman et al: facilitate comparisons, reveal trends.

    - Effectiveness -> theme + grammar -> plot/tooling -> EDA
3. Let's look at some about what makes a plot _effective_ and _ineffective_.
    - We've seen "show me the data": Pinhead plot vs. jitter+violin.
    - Beware of overplotting.
