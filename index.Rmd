# About This Guide {-}

Welcome to the class meeting (or "lecture") guide for STAT 545A and STAT 547M at UBC for the 2019/20 academic year! This guide organizes what we will be doing in each class meeting. So you can expect it to be updated regularly -- in fact, the date listed above is the last time this guide was updated. 

If you're looking for the list of tutorials written by Jenny Bryan, you can find those in the bookdown book found at stat545.com.
