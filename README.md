The "lecture notes" of STAT 545A and 547M are hosted here, using `bookdown`. Just push a change to this repo, and Travis CI will build the book, and netlify will deploy the book, all automatically.

Notation: 

- `cmxyy` stands for class meeting number `yy`, where `x=0` stands for STAT 545A, and `x=1` 547M.
- The ordering of these files matters! It determines the "chapter" order.

When editing, make sure you reserve Level 1 headers for a new lecture (or new "Part", like a STAT 545A part and a STAT 547M part).
