# Authoring

**UNDER REVISION**

Today, we'll be looking at writing documents. md, Rmd, presentations. bookdown? blogdown?

To participate in today's lecture, you should have:

- A GitHub account
- RStudio installed

__Announcements__:

- The add/drop deadline for Stat 545A is on Wednesday Sep. 11

## Learning Objectives

By the end of today's class, students are expected to be able to:

- Name three key uses of plain text, and some types of plain text for each
- Author basic documents in ordinary markdown (easier than you think!) with RStudio
- Render a markdown document to html and pdf using RStudio
- Choose whether html or pdf is an appropriate output

Rmd

- Create an R Markdown (Rmd) document and render it to md/html/pdf
- Write basic equations in Rmd using LaTeX
- Style an Rmd document by editing the YAML header
- Demonstrate at least two Rmd code chunk options
- Informatively choose between writing an R script/Rmd/R Notebook.

## Resources

Here are some resources that are well-aligned with today's goals:

- The [stat545: Rmd test drive](http://stat545.com/block007_first-use-rmarkdown.html). Read this if you missed something from today's class.
- The [Rmd website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) has a fantastic walk-through [tutorial](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) that gives a great overview of R Markdown. The following lessons parallel today's content:
    - Lessons 1-4 (Intro - Inline Code)
    - Lessons 9-10 (Output Formats - Notebooks)

Here are resources that are great to reference:

- The official [Rmd cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf) has seemingly everything bundled together in a concise way.
- An updated list of options for the YAML header can be found in the [rmd book: html-document](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html)

To dig deeper into any (?) aspect of R Markdown, check out the free [R Markdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) (also listed on the course syllabus).

## Topic 1: Output Formats

There are generally two accepted non-proprietary file types for manuscripts of various types:

1. __pdf__: This is useful if you intend to print your work onto a physical sheet of paper. If this is not the primary purpose, then avoid at all costs, because formatting things so that it fits to the page is way more effort than its worth. 
2. __html__: This is what you see when you visit a webpage. Content does not need to be partitioned to pages. 

We won't be using proprietary file types, like MS Word. Amongst [many reasons](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/10/why-microsoft-word-must-die.html), it just doesn't make sense to integrate reproducible code into the document.

We'll be treating pdf and html files as output that should not be edited. In fact, pdf documents are not even easy to edit, and even if you do pay for the Adobe add-on to edit the files, it's not a reproducible workflow.

What's the source, then? (R) __Markdown__!




Motivation for plain text:

- authoring: 
    - Delegating the formatting saves time and is distraction-free
    - Word documents may get formatted differently across versions
    - Automate numbering
    - Automate changes to the formatting
    - Less error-prone (eg. matching font sizes)
    - ...

- authoring
    - __markdown__ (`.md`) (and family!)
    - LaTeX (`.tex`)
    - You could say HTML, too...


Some noteworthy things:

- Rich text is different from syntax highlighting
- The _file viewer_ is independent from the _file_
    - Less so with proprietary software such as Word. 
- With plain text, the file extension doesn't really matter. 

## Topic 2: Markdown

### Output formats

HTML vs pdf

### Live coding activity:

1. Open RStudio, and open a new text file. 
2. Save the file, and call it `md_explorer.md`
3. Add content to the document, using some markdown syntax such as:
    - Headers
    - Bold, Italics
    - Code font
    - Hyperlinks
4. Click `Preview` to convert the md file to HTML. Try pdf, too!
    - Which to use? In general: printing to the page, pdf. Viewing on the screen, HTML.

Notable "flavours"/extensions to the basic markdown:

- GitHub-flavoured Markdown (Assignment 1)
- R Markdown (A future lesson)

Resources:

- [Original Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
- [Cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) for md and gh-flavoured md. 
- [Tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/) for learning markdown.

## Topic 3: R Markdown


### Getting Started

You'll need to install R Markdown. To do so, in any R console, run the following:

```
install.packages('rmarkdown')
```

### Cross-referencing

Figures, sections, tables

### Code chunks

### YAML

### Bib References?

### Demonstration

Let's play with Rmd. No need to submit anything for participation marks! We'll do that next time when we explore data frames.

1. Create a new Rmd document: File -> New File -> R Markdown...
2. Title: "Data Frame Exploration".

- Notice the differences from regular markdown: YAML header, code chunks!

3. Save it -- I'll call it `cm003-exercise-df`.
4. Click `Knit`.
5. Try other outputs.
6. Try LaTeX equations.
7. Try inserting new chunks of code.
8. Try changing the theme with YAML.
9. Try changing chunk options.
10. Try making an R _Notebook_. 
    - R script/Rmd/R Notebook -- which to use?


## Topic 4: Presentations

ioslides, xaringan, etc.
