# Authoring


Today, we'll be looking at writing documents. md, Rmd, presentations. bookdown? blogdown?

To participate in today's lecture, you should have:

- A GitHub account
- RStudio installed

## Learning Objectives: Plain Text

By the end of today's class, students are expected to be able to:

- Name three key uses of plain text, and some types of plain text for each
- Author basic documents in ordinary markdown (easier than you think!) with RStudio
- Render a markdown document to html and pdf using RStudio
- Choose whether html or pdf is an appropriate output

## Orientation to Plain Text

Three uses of plain text relevant to data analytic work:

- authoring
- data storage
- scripts

Motivation for plain text:

- authoring: 
    - Delegating the formatting saves time and is distraction-free
    - Automate numbering
    - Automate changes to the formatting
    - Less error-prone (eg. matching font sizes)
    - ...
- data storage and scripts:
    - always machine readable

Types of plain text for each, with typical file extensions. STAT 545 focusses on those in __bold__:

- authoring
    - __markdown__ (`.md`) (and family!)
    - LaTeX (`.tex`)
    - You could say HTML, too...
- data storage
    - __csv/comma-separated values__ (`.csv`)
    - tsv/tab-separated values (`.tsv`)
    - JSON (`.json`)
    - XML (`.xml`) (although not its only use)
- scripts
    - __R__ (`.r`) -- _Next week_
    - python (`.py`)
    - javascript (`.js`)

Some noteworthy things:

- Rich text is different from syntax highlighting
- The _file viewer_ is independent from the _file_
    - Less so with proprietary software such as Word. 
- With plain text, the file extension doesn't really matter. 

## Markdown Crash Course

Cheatsheet: https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf

Live coding activity:

1. Open RStudio, and open a new text file. 
2. Save the file, and call it `md_explorer.md`
3. Add content to the document, using some markdown syntax such as:
    - Headers
    - Bold, Italics
    - Code font
    - Hyperlinks
4. Click `Preview` to convert the md file to HTML. Try pdf, too!
    - Which to use? In general: printing to the page, pdf. Viewing on the screen, HTML.

Notable "flavours"/extensions to the basic markdown:

- GitHub-flavoured Markdown (Assignment 1)
- R Markdown (A future lesson)

Resources:

- [Original Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
- [Cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) for md and gh-flavoured md. 
- [Tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/) for learning markdown.

## Presentations

ioslides, xaringan, etc.

## If we finish early

### csv files

- Their use for tabular data
- Their structure
- Editing them by hand

### More Markdown

Let's learn more about markdown, with a think-pair-share activity.

1. Form groups of size `n` (determined in-class)
2. "Think"-iteration: Each person is responsible for learning about a different type of markdown formatting, for 3 minutes:
    - Inserting images
    - Lists
    - Blockquotes
    - Code blocks
3. "Pair"-iteration: For max 1 minute per person, each person either:
    - teaches the other group members how to use the formatting they learned, OR
    - if you're lost, ask your group members for help on the basics. 
        - Don't feel bad! This happens and is normal, and is also useful for your team members. 
4. "Share"-iteration: Volunteer to share something that you learned!
