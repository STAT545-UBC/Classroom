### Create your project repo and add your partner as admin

1. Go to the [STAT547 - Spring 2020 organization](https://github.com/STAT547-UBC-2019-20/)
2. On the right of the page, click the green "New" button
3. For the repository name, set it to "group_xx_yy" where xx is your group number (from canvas) and yy is an optional name of your repo
4. Keep this repo private (for now)
5. Initialize the repo with a README, add a .gitignore file (for R) and a license (MIT is fine).
6. Once at the home page of your repo, click "Settings", then "Manage Access"
7. Add your team member, and give them Admin access.
7. THERE IS NO NEED TO add any of the teaching team to your repo, we will have access as long as it's created inside the STAT547 organization.

### Setup your local directories, and RStudio to work nicely with GitHub

1. Locally on my machine, create a new folder called stat547 in a sensible place: <SENSIBLE_PATH>
2. Create folders for each of your main areas: `Discussion`, `assignments`, `project`, `participation`
3. On GitHub.com visit each of these repositories and copy the git repo URL into these spots
	- `Discussion`: https://github.com/STAT547-UBC-2019-20/Discussions.git
	- `assignment_01`: ## LINK TO THIS REPO
	- `participation`: ## LINK TO THIS REPO
4. Create a new RStudio project for each of the repos above
	- Open RStudio then click File >> New Project >> Version Control >> Git
	- In the "Repository URL" field, paste the URL for one of the repos above
	- In the "Project directory name" field, you should leave this as the name of the repo to avoid confusion
	- In the "Create project as subdirectory of:" field, use the <SENSIBLE_PATH> from Step 1.
	- Click "Create Project" 
	- You should repeat this step (Step 4) for every assignment that you accept in STAT547.
5. Now you have correctly set up RStudio with Git so you can commit, pull, push, etc... right from RStudio!
6. At the beginning of every lecture, open the "Discussion" RStudio project. Then click on the "Git" tab, and then pull the latest `cm1xx_participation.Rmd` file directly to your computer. Copy it to your participation repo, commit it, and then push.

### Activity 1: Fork and clone workflow

For your team project, you should be working in a "fork and clone" workflow (unless you consider yourself a git master). 
More details about this workflow are described [here](https://happygitwithr.com/fork-and-clone.html) in happygitwithr.com

Here is what you need to do:

1. Go to your project repo, called `group_xx_yy`
2. Click the "fork" button on the repo home page
3. Make sure you fork the repo within the STAT547 organization
4. Copy the URL of YOUR fork of the main project repo
    - Git URL of YOUR fork: ## LINK TO THIS REPO
5. Also grab the URL of the MAIN PROJECT REPO
    - Git URL of MAIN PROJECT REPO: ## LINK TO THIS REPO 
6. Create a new RStudio project and repeat Step 4 from the previous section for YOUR FORK of the main project repo
7. Now, we need to "link" the main project repoto YOUR FORK so you can send your changes back to the main project repo, and also receive any changes your partner made. To do this:
    - In RStudio, find the "console"button and click on it
    - Now you're in a Terminal/Console (yes, *within* RStudio, weird - I know)
    - Make sure you're in the correct directory (YOUR FORK cloned locally) by typing in `pwd`
    - Type this command to link the MAIN PROJECT repo to your fork:
      - `git remote add upstream <MAIN_PROJECT_REPO_URL>`
      - Done!
8. To check if it worked, type this in the RStudio console:
    - `git fetch upstream`
    - If there are changes it will let you know what they are
    - Once you're ready to pull the changes into YOUR FORK of the MAIN PROJECT repo, use this command:
    - `git merge upstream/master`
    - This will merge all the changes from the upstream URL (<MAIN_PROJECT_REPO_URL>) into your fork
    - Do this often!
9. It is best practice to create a new branch in a forked repo so your work isn't committed to master:
    - `git checkout -b name_of_your_new_branch`

### Activity 2: Send a PR from YOUR FORK back to the MAIN PROJECT

1. Will be demo'd

### Activity 3: "Catching up"

1. Accept a PR from your partner in the MAIN PROJECT repo
2. Merge those changes into YOUR FORK using `git merge upstream/master`
    - Deal with any merge conflicts that arise
3. Send another PR now with even more changes, hopefully if everything was done correctly, the new changes should allow us to easily merge the PR in with the main code.

### (Optional) Activity 4: Class wide

You can do this all on GitHub.com - no need to clone locally.

1. Fork this [git demos](https://github.com/STAT547-UBC-2019-20/git_demos) repo
2. Create a branch called 'my_change'
3. Make a change in the `introductions.md` file
4. Create a PR and send it to the main `git_demos` repo
5. Let's see if we can get all 30 PRs merged in!

### Final: Provide links for the various sections of the git activity:

- Link for your fork of the project repo: ## YOUR LINK HERE
- Link to the Pull request (PR) you sent in the main repo: ## YOUR LINK HERE
- Link to the commit after fixing the merge conflict in the main repo : ## YOUR LINK HERE
- Link to the commit after you pulled changes from the upstream branch

## Part 3: Vectorization

Many thanks to one of our teaching assistants [Sirine Chahma](https://github.com/sirine-chahma) for the first draft of this lecture!

### What is vectorization?

There are several ways of applying the same operation to all the elements of a given vector.

You can "brute force" it:

```{r, bruteforce_multiplication}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
y <- c()

y[1] = x[1]*2
y[2] = x[2]*2
y[3] = x[3]*2
y[3] = x[4]*2
```

But it's very easy to make mistakes when you're copy/pasting code like this so it's a good rule of thumb to think of better ways to do things when you have to copy and paste the same block of code more than about once.

Let's try this again:

```{r, bruteforce_multiplication2}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
y <- c()

y[1] = x[1]*2
y[2] = x[2]*2
y[3] = x[2]*2
y[4] = x[4]*2

y
```

Rats! We made another mistake. 
Find and fix the mistake in the code above please!

Okay, let's get to the better way of doing things.

You can use a loop : 

```{r, loop_multiplication}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
y <- c()

for (i in 1:length(x)){
  y[i] <- x[i]*2
}

y
```

There is a function called `seq_along` that essentially replaces `1:length(x)` in the code chunk above:

```{r, loop_multiplication2}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
y <- c()

for (i in seq_along(x)){
  y[i] <- x[i]*2
}

y
```
We will use `seq_along(x)` and `1:length(x)` interchangeably. 

So, this works and is much less error-prone, but in this case - there is actually an even better option, - vectorized operations! 
Let's see an example of it:

```{r, vectorized_multiplication}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)

y <- x*2
y
```

You might have thought this was an obvious thing to try, and you'd be right - R has some built in functions to handle vectorization "behind the scenes".
For example, we can sum the values of two vectors :  

```{r, loop_addition}
x1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
x2 <- c(10, 20, 30, 40)
y <- c()

for (i in 1:length(x1)){
  y[i] <- x1[i] + x2[i]
}

y
```

but built-in vectorization in R allows us to do this: 

```{r, vectorized_addition}
x1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
x2 <- c(10, 20, 30, 40)

y <- x1 + x2
y
```

### Why do we use vectorization?

Let's come back to the first example we saw (multiply the values of a vector by 2), but let's use a bigger vector this time.


```{r, create_big_vector}
x <- 1:100000000
print(glue('The length of x is ', length(x)))
```

Take a guess at how long the loop below is going to take to run (Hint: the answer is "in the seconds")?

```
# Guess at how long this loop takes

x <- 1:100000000
for (i in 1:length(x)){
  y[i] <- 2*x[i]
}

## YOUR GUESS HERE
```
Let's try using the `tictoc` package to time how long this operation takes.
`tic` starts the clock, and `toc` stops the clock and prints out the total time.

```{r, long_loop, eval = FALSE}

y <- c()

#start timing
tic()
for (i in 1:length(x)){
  y[i] <- 2*x[i]
}

#end timing
toc()
```

Let's take a look at the time taken by the vectorized operation now : 

```{r, long_vectorization}

#start timming
tic()

y <- x*2

#end timming
toc()
```

Wow! That is amazing - see how much faster the vectorized operation is compared to the `for` loop.
It's usually recommended to use vectorized operation rather than regular loops for several reasons, including memory efficiency, speed, readability, "debugability", and easily being able to add tests (more on this next week).

### Other vectorized operations

Here are a few examples of other operations that are vectorized.

- Check if the values of two vectors are the same : 

```{r, boolean_equal}

x1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
x2 <- c(1, 2, 1, 2)

y <- x1 == x2

# Can you guess the values of `y`?
print("YOUR GUESS HERE")
```

And the answer is (run in RStudio):
```{r, answer_boolean_equal, eval = FALSE}
y
```

- Compare the values of two vectors :

```{r, boolean_greater}

x1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
x2 <- c(1, 2, 1, 2)

y <- x1 > x2

# Can you guess the values of `y`?
print("YOUR SOLUTION HERE")
```

And the answer is: 

```{r, answer_boolean_greater, eval = FALSE}
y
```

- Logical comparaisons can also be used: 

```{r, logical}

# compares each elements of each vector by position
y <- c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE) & c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
y
```

There are a lot of other operations that are vectorized! 
Here is a list of vector operators : [R Operators cheat sheet](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Baggott-refcard-v2.pdf)

### Functional programming using the `purrr` package

Until now, we have just applied simple operations to vectors. 
The functions were only applied to a single element of the vector, which were doubles. 
What if we want to use data frames (as you likely will in your projects)? 
In this case, one "element" becomes a whole vector (a column of the data frame), and the functions have to accept a vector as an input. 

Let's now try to work with data frames. 
How do we apply a function to all the columns of a data frame?

We are going to work with the `iris` data frame : 

```{r, load_df}
#select only the columns that represents a numerical variable
iris_df <- iris %>% 
  select(-Species)

head(iris_df)
```

Let's compute the mean of each column using a for loop :

```{r,, mean_loop}
means <- vector("double", ncol(iris_df))

## YOUR SOLUTION HERE
for (i in seq_along(iris_df)) {
    means[i] <- mean(iris_df[[i]], na.rm = TRUE)
}
```

`means` contains the means of each column : 

```{r, answer_mean_loop, eval = FALSE}
means
```

We can do the same to find the minimum of each column : 

```{r, min_loop}
mins <- vector("double", ncol(iris_df))

## YOUR SOLUTION HERE
for (i in seq_along(iris_df)) {
    mins[i] <- min(iris_df[[i]], na.rm = TRUE)
}
```

`mins` contains the minimums of each column : 

```{r, answer_min_loop, eval = FALSE}
mins
```

The two loops we just wrote seem to very similar to each other, we should try to write a function that takes the function we want to apply and a data frame as its inputs.

```{r, my_map_function}

my_function <- function(x, fun)  {
    value <- vector("double", ncol(x))
    for (i in seq_along(x)) {
        value[i] <- fun(x[[i]], na.rm = TRUE)
    }
    value
}
```

Let's check if we find the same values as before. 
Try calling `my_function` to compute the `mean` and `min` of `iris_df`: 

```{r, my_function_mean}
## YOUR SOLUTION HERE
my_function(iris_df, mean)
```

```{r, my_function_min}
## YOUR SOLUTION HERE
my_function(iris_df, min)
```

We find exactly the same values as when we were using the for loop! 

*Note*: We have just written a functional, which is a *function* that takes *another function* as an input, and returns a vector as an output. 

Just as a preview, the `purrr` package has some really convenient function(al)s that allow us to pass in other functions to apply to data frame. 

### The most general `purrr` function: `map`

The `purrr:map` function takes at least two arguments : a data frame and a function.

`map(.x, .f, ...)`

This means that we are going to apply the function `f` for every element of `x`.

This image may help you to better understand what does the `purrr:map` function does : 

<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/12f6af8404d9723dff9cc665028a35f07759299d/d0d9a/diagrams/functionals/map-list.png" width=500>
Source: [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html) by Hadley Wickham.

*Note* : In this image, the elements of the object that are used as an input seem to be the rows, but when we use a data frame as the input, they actually correspond to the columns of the data frame.

Let's calculate the mean of the columns of the iris data frame : 

```{r, purrr_mean_map}
library(purrr)
map(iris_df, mean)
```

The only difference with our `my_function` function we created above is that the output is a list! 

### Use the right `purrr::map*` function based on your desired output

Now, let's take a look at the other functions that exist in the `purrr` library.
Here is a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/purrr.pdf) that contains a list of all the functions, and how to use them.
We have `map_chr` (character vector), `map_dbl` (double/numeric vector), `map_dfc` (dfc for dataframe columns and dfr for dataframe rows), `map_int` (integer) and `map_lgl` (logical).

Let's practice with `purrr:map_dbl`: 

```{r, purrr_mean_map_dbl}
library(purrr)
map_dbl(iris_df, mean)
```

This time, the output is a vector containing doubles! 
This is exactly what we had with the function we created.

What if we want to specify some arguments of our function (ignore the NAs when we compute the mean for instance)?
We need to do a bit of work to do that - essentially we need to tell the `map` functional to also consider the `na.rm` argument of the mean function.
Let's see how...

### Specify some arguments of the function

Let's introduce some missing data in our data frame : 

```{r, missing_data}
iris_NA <- iris_df
iris_NA[1, 1] <- NA
```

What happens if we use `purrr:map_dbl`? 
```{r, answer_map_dbl_NA}
map_dbl(iris_NA, mean)
```

The mean of the first column is now equal to NA. To solve this issue, we can use `na.rm = TRUE` as an argument of the `mean` function. But how do we add this to our `map_dbl` call?

We have to create what we call an *anonymous function*.

```{r, answer_map_dbl_anonymous_fun}
map_dbl(iris_NA, function(df) mean(df, na.rm  = TRUE))
```

The general format of an anonymous function is `function(x) body of the function`. 
For example, if you want to compute $4^2$ using an anonymous function, it would be : 

```{r, anonymous_fun_example}
(function(x) x**2)(4)
```

The anonymous function is surrounded by round brackets, and so is the input of the anonymous function.

*Note* : There is a shorter way to write anonymous functions : 

```{r, short_anonymous_fun}
map_dbl(iris_NA, ~ mean(., na.rm  = TRUE))
```

The `function(df)` is replaced by `~` and the argument of the function is replaced by a `.`. 

### Mapping with two data objects

So far, we have only used the `purrr:map` function that only takes one data object and one function as an argument. 
What if we wanted to do more complicated operations, that use a function that needs more than one input? 

For example, how would you calculate the weighted means (using `weighted.mean`) of the columns of a given data frame, where the weights are in another data frame?

Let's create a data frame that contains the weights picking some randomly generated values from the `iris_NA` dataset (according to the poisson distribution using the `rpois` function) : 

```{r, create_weights}

weights <- tibble(weight_sepal_legth = rpois(nrow(iris_NA), 3),
                  weight_sepal_width = rpois(nrow(iris_NA), 3),
                  weight_petal_legth = rpois(nrow(iris_NA), 3), 
                  weight_petal_width = rpois(nrow(iris_NA), 3),)
```

First, let's see what are the parameters of `weighted.mean`

```{r, weighted_mean_parameters}
?weighted.mean
```

In order to know which `purrr:map*` function we have to use, you can consult the handy table where each row is the table corresponds to "the thing you want to map". 
Each column represents the type you want the "output" of the map function to be, either a list, an atomic (vector), the same type as the input, and no output (useful if you want to modify things in place).

<img src="img/map_family.png" width=900>

Source: [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html) by Hadley Wickham.

As we have two arguments, we should use the `purrr:map2*` function. As we want the output of the function to be a data frame, we are goint to use `purrr:map2_df`. 

```{r, map2_NA}
map2_df(iris_NA, weights, weighted.mean)
```

We have the same issue as before because of the NAs... We should use an anonymous function! 

```{r, map2_NA_anonymous_function}
map2_df(iris_NA, weights, function(x, y) weighted.mean(x, y, na.rm = TRUE))
```

What would be the short form of this anonymous function?

```{r, answer_map2_NA_anonymous_function_short}
## YOUR SOLUTION HERE
map2_df(iris_NA, weights, ~ weighted.mean(.x, .y, na.rm = TRUE))
```

*WARNING* : if `y` has less elements than `x`, the elements of `y` will be used several times. 
This could have some nasty side-effects, but is also quite useful!

Source: [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html) by Hadley Wickham.

### Mapping with more than two data object

When we have more than two arguments, we should use the `purrr:pmap*` function.

```{r, pmap_example}
f <-  function(x, y, z, arg = 0){
  (x+y+z)/3 + arg
}

pmap(list(c(1, 1), c(1, 2), c(1, 3)), f)
```

If we want to use an anonymous function, we have to us `..1, ..2, ..3`.

```{r, pmap_anonymous_function}
pmap(list(c(1, 1), c(1, 2), c(1, 3)), ~ f(..1, ..2, ..3, arg=2))
```

*Note* : if you use `purrr:pmap*` on a single data frame, it will iterate row-wise!

Example : Try to find the mean of all the rows of the `iris_df` dataset (which doesn't really make sense, but let's do it anyway).

```{r, answer_pmap_row}
## YOUR SOLUTION HERE
pmap(iris_df, ~ mean(.x)) %>% 
  head()
```
