# Introduction to STAT 545 and GitHub

By the end of today's class, students are expected to be able to:

- List 4 ways to get help in this course
- Create and comment on GitHub Issues

## Learning Objectives

The concepts we'll be looking at are:

- Commits
- Diffs
- Commit History
- Branches
- Merging
- Merge Conflicts

Specifically, by the end of today's class, students are expected to be able to:

- Describe the difference between git and GitHub, and name similar software
- Edit plain text files on different branches on GitHub
- Navigate the commit history of various repository branches on GitHub
- Visualize a tree diagram of commits across branches
- Merge repository branches via pull requests on GitHub, resolving merge conflicts if necessary

GitHub offers [a nice tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) on getting started with GitHub that you might find useful.


## Your Turn: GitHub activity

[5 minute timer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxQWLbdGLfE).

1. Register for a free account on github.com. You'll be using this account for the duration of the course.
    - Want detailed instructions? See [happygitwithr: Section 5](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html)
2. Complete [this survey](https://forms.gle/VWYLQpyt7eNXdvZu6).
3. Navigate to the [Announcements](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-hw-2019-20/Announcements) repository.
4. Click `Watch` on the upper-right corner of the repo
    - This is so that you get email notifications whenever an announcement is posted (under the "Issues" tab).
5. Go to the Issues section of the repository, and comment on the Issue I created called "Introduce yourself!". In the comment, say who you are, and greet the person above you -- be sure to tag them by their username using `@username`. 
6. Please put up a profile photo -- it makes the STAT 545 community more personable. You can do this from your profile homepage. 
7. OPTIONAL: Register for the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) with GitHub for a bunch of free perks for students!

## About Version Control

What is version control?

Why bother with version control?

- Don't fret removing stuff
- Leave a breadcrumb trail for troubleshooting
- "Undo" to a previous state
- Helps you define your work
- ...

What software is associated with version control?

- git, subversion, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, ...

## Live-Coding: Making a new repo

To demonstrate version control concepts, we'll create a new GitHub repository, which will showcase our markdown exploration. 


1. Create a new repository for your homework.
    - Counts towards participation, so please keep this repo until the course is complete.
2. Say YES to initializing with a README.
3. Edit the README with something descriptive, like:
    - > This repo is part of a STAT 545 exercise to explore GitHub and markdown.
4. _Commit_ the changes, adding a _commit message_.
5. Drag and drop the `.md`, `.html`, and `.pdf` files that you made earlier in class onto the main repo page.
6. Explore the files in your repo. What's viewable? What's not?
    - Food for thought: Jenny Bryan on repo browsability: [happygitwithr repo-browsability](http://happygitwithr.com/repo-browsability.html).

You should now have a repo with a README file, and your `.md`, `.pdf`, and `.html` files from before. 

## Commits

Commits, diffs, and commit history.

## Live-Coding: Branching and Merging

The notion of _branching_ and _merging_ shows up seemingly everywhere in version control. You'll encounter _merge conflicts_, too.

To demonstrate concepts, let's look at a _repository branch_. There are other types of branches, as we'll see. For more info on this, see [the GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/). 

NOTE: I'm deferring the motivation for repo branching until later. 

1. Create a new branch via the home page of your repo (find the "branch" button). Call it `test1`.
2. To the README on the `test1` branch, add a relative link to the other `.md` file in the repo (using markdown syntax).
3. Explore: 
    - switch between branches to see that the repo structure is different.
    - Diagram of commit history for both branches.
4. Merge the branch to "master".

Part 2: 

1. Make a new branch called `test2`.
2. Edit line 1 of the README _on both branches_ to something different in both cases.
3. Try merging. You'll get a _merge conflict_ -- go ahead and resolve it, then merge. 

## Collaboration with GitHub

## Learning Objectives: Collaboration with GitHub

The primary focus here is learning about __leveraging GitHub's version control for collaboration__. The concepts are:

- GitHub Pages
- Forking
- Pull Request

Specifically, by the end of today's class, students are expected to:

- Be able to make a basic website out of your participation repository using GitHub Pages
- Know roughly what the above concepts are about

## Resources

The GitHub documentation is perhaps the best place to learn about these outside of class:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
    - [happygitwithr: fork](http://happygitwithr.com/fork.html) is also a good resource.
- [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)

## Demonstration

For participation marks, by the end of this demonstration: 

- you'll have a GitHub pages website set up for your participation repo
- you __don't need to have__ anything for the forking exercise!

Checklist:

1. Set up a basic "GitHub pages" website with your participation repo:
    1. Go to "settings" on your repo.
    2. Scroll down to "GitHub Pages"
    3. Under "Source", click the "None" drop-down button, and select the branch you want to turn into a website.
2. Forking a repo: 
    1. Let's try forking the `Classroom` repo.
    2. We'll make a change, and will submit a pull request.


## Quiz

(to make??)

- Rank? What are four ways to ask for help in this course? In real life?
- What is a github repository? Org? Issue?


## To do before next time

- Please fill out [this survey](https://goo.gl/forms/UPvRA6a9WRod8JPb2), so that we can match you to your GitHub account.
- Remember to bring your laptop to every class, as we will have live-coding activities. 
- Install the software stack for this course, as indicated below. Having trouble? Our wonderful TA's are here to help you during office hours.

1. Sign up for a GitHub account on github.com
2. Install R and RStudio.
    - R here: <https://cloud.r-project.org>
    - RStudio here: <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/>
    - Commentary on installing this stuff can be found at [stat545.com: r-rstudio-install](http://stat545.com/block000_r-rstudio-install.html)
3. Install git. See [happygitwithr: Section 7](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html)
    - You'll need to work with the command line. 
4. LaTeX?
