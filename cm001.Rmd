# Introduction to STAT 545 and GitHub

## Outline

We'll cover three topics today:

- Syllabus. (~20 min)
- GitHub. (~20 min)
- Getting help (~20 min)

We'll end class with:

- a "quiz",
- a to-do list before next class.


## Learning Objectives


By the end of today's class, students are expected to be able to:


- Find a repo, Org, or user page.
- Edit plain text files on GitHub
- Navigate the commit history of various repository branches on GitHub


## Resources

Today's section in the guidebook should contain everything you need to know about today's topics.

If you want to learn more:

- Check out the [GitHub guide](https://guides.github.com/) for lots of info about GitHub. If you do go here, I recommend you start with ["Hello, World!"](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). You'll see stuff about branching there -- we'll get there next Thursday.


## Topic 1: Syllabus (20 min)

- Guidebook (2 min)
- Learning Objectives and Course Structure (8 min)
  - Example of an analysis: `Interpreting-Regression` book.
- Teaching Team and Contact (5 min)
- Resources, especially what's going on with stat545.com (5 min)

## Topic 2: GitHub (20 min)

We will be using [GitHub](https://github.com) a lot in this course. It's being used for:

- All course-related work will go here.
- Discussion will happen here.
- Even this guidebook and the STAT 545 website files are on GitHub.

But why GitHub? You'll see that it's very effective for developing a project. Examples:

- [Apple](https://github.com/apple) uses it.
- [Uber](https://github.com/uber) uses it.
- [Netflix](https://github.com/Netflix) uses it.
- [This Guidebook](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom) and [the STAT545 @ UBC website](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-home) use it.
- Prominent R packages like [`ggplot2`](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) use it. 

#### Your turn: register a GitHub account (3 min)

1. Register for a free account on [github.com](https://github.com). You'll be using this account for the duration of the course.
    - Give your username [some thought](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#username-advice) -- ideally, should include your name.
2. Tell us what your username is by filling out [this survey](https://forms.gle/VWYLQpyt7eNXdvZu6).

### GitHub as cloud storage

Distinguish between an Organization, user, and repository

### GitHub as cloud storage - Activity 

__Make a participation repo__.

- Together: make a participation repo. Submit it to canvas right away. Say YES to initializing with a README. Make a new file for the next activity.

__navigating GitHub__

- Together: find ... and put the URL on the new file.
- Your turn: find your user page; STAT 545 hw Org; the Announcements repo. Put on participation repo.

### GitHub for collaboration

- hosts the "official" current state of a project -- no more confusing this.
- Create and comment on GitHub Issues; `Watch`ing a repo; goodbye emails.

### GitHub for collaboration - Activity 

Together: `Watch`ing a repo

3. Navigate to the [Announcements](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-hw-2019-20/Announcements) repository.
4. Click `Watch` on the upper-right corner of the repo
    - This is so that you get email notifications whenever an announcement is posted (under the "Issues" tab).

### GitHub for version control with git

GitHub uses a program called `git` to keep track of the project's history (more about `git` next Thursday).

- Users make "commits" to form a commit history.
- `git` only tracks the _changes_, so it doesn't need to take a full snapshot each time.

Why?

- Don't fret removing stuff
- Leave a breadcrumb trail for troubleshooting
- "Undo" to a previous state
- Helps you define your work
- ...

### GitHub for version control with git - Activity 

commit history

- View the commit history of a repository. Paste the URL into an md file in your participation repo.


## Topic 3: Getting Help

- List 4 ways to get help in this course
- Activity: search stack exchange or other gh issues for examples. Reply to Issue in Announcements.


### Your turn: commenting on an Issue

Go to the Issues section of the [Announcements repository](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-hw-2019-20), and comment on the Issue I created called "Introduce yourself!". In the comment, say who you are, and greet the person above you -- be sure to tag them by their username using `@username`. 


## Wrap-up

Quiz:

- Examples of good and bad help questions
- Examples of approaches to get unstuck.
- Where to post a question/comment in STAT 545.

## To do before next class

- Please fill out [this survey](https://goo.gl/forms/UPvRA6a9WRod8JPb2), so that we can match you to your GitHub account.
- Be sure to complete the in-class activities listed in today's section of the guidebook.
- Please put up a profile photo on GitHub -- it makes the STAT 545 community more personable.
- Install the software stack for this course, as indicated below. Having trouble? Our wonderful TA's are here to help you during office hours.

Optionally, register for the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) with GitHub for a bunch of free perks for students!

And remember: bring your laptop to every class, as we will always have live-coding activities. 

### Software Stack Installation

1. Install R and RStudio.
    - R here: <https://cloud.r-project.org>
    - RStudio here: <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/>
    - Commentary on installing this stuff can be found at [stat545.com: r-rstudio-install](http://stat545.com/block000_r-rstudio-install.html)
2. Install git (this is different from GitHub!). See [happygitwithr: Section 7](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html)
    - You'll need to work with the command line.
