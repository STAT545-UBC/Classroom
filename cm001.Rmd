# Introduction to STAT 545 and GitHub

## Outline

We'll cover three topics today:

- Syllabus. (~20 min)
- GitHub. (~20 min)
- Getting help (~20 min)

We'll end class with:

- a "quiz",
- a to-do list before next class.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of today's class, students are expected to be able to:

- Find a repo, Org, or user page.
- Edit plain text files on GitHub
- Navigate the commit history of various repository branches on GitHub


## Resources

Today's section in the guidebook should contain everything you need to know about today's topics.

If you want to learn more:

- Check out the [GitHub guide](https://guides.github.com/) for lots of info about GitHub. If you do go here, I recommend you start with ["Hello, World!"](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). You'll see stuff about branching there -- we'll get there next Thursday.


## Topic 1: Syllabus (20 min)

The course syllabus can be found on the STAT 545 @ UBC homepage, [stat545.stat.ubc.ca](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca). We'll cover:

- Guidebook (2 min)
- Learning Objectives and Course Structure (8 min)
  - Example of an analysis: `Interpreting-Regression` book.
- Teaching Team and Contact (5 min)
- Resources, especially what's going on with stat545.com (5 min)

## Topic 2: GitHub (20 min)

We will be using [GitHub](https://github.com) a lot in this course:

- All course-related work will go on GitHub.
- Discussion will happen on GitHub.
- Even this guidebook and the STAT 545 website files are on GitHub.

But why GitHub? Because it's tremendously effective for developing a project. Examples:

- [Apple](https://github.com/apple) uses it.
- [Uber](https://github.com/uber) uses it.
- [Netflix](https://github.com/Netflix) uses it.
- [This Guidebook](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom) and [the STAT545 @ UBC website](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-home) use it.
- Prominent R packages like [`ggplot2`](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) use it. 

Today, we'll check out:

1. GitHub as cloud storage;
2. GitHub for collaboration; and
3. GitHub for version control with git.

### Register a GitHub account - Activity (3 min)

1. Register for a free account on [github.com](https://github.com). 
    - You'll be using this account for the duration of the course.
    - Give your username [some thought](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#username-advice) -- ideally, should include your name.
2. Tell us what your username is by filling out [this survey](https://forms.gle/VWYLQpyt7eNXdvZu6).

### GitHub as cloud storage

At the very least, GitHub allows for cloud storage, like Google Drive and Dropbox do. There's a bit more structure than just storing files under your account:

- __User Accounts__ vs. __Organization Accounts (aka "Org")__: You can store files with your own GitHub _user account_ (that you just made); or, you can store files with a separate _Organization_ account that multiple people can own. User accounts typically contain files relevant to an individual, whereas Orgs typically contain files relevant to (you guessed it) organizations.
- __Repositories (aka "repo")__: In any account, your files must be organized into different _repositories_. Think of these as self-contained projects. These can either be _public_ or _private_.

Examples: 

- The [`ggplot2`](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) repo, within its corresponding `tidyverse` Org. 
- My [website](https://github.com/vincenzocoia/website) repo, within my own user account.

Want to read more about GitHub accounts? [Check out this help page on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/types-of-github-accounts).

### GitHub as cloud storage - Activity 

__Together: Make a participation repo__

1. Make a new repository:
    - On GitHub, click the "+" in the top-right corner -> "New repository"
    - Call it `STAT545-participation`
    - Say YES to initializing with a README. 
2. Link your repo to canvas by submitting a URL to your repo in the participation assessment. 
    - Don't worry, we won't grade it until it's finished. 
3. Make a new file for the next activity:
    - Click on the "Create New File" button on your repository's home page.
    - Call it `navigating_github.md`
    - Leave it blank, and commit ("save") the file by clicking on green "commit new file" button at the bottom of the page.

__Navigating GitHub__

- Together: Add the following URL's to your `navigating_github.md` file (click on the pen button to edit), together with some commentary:
    - The repository for the `broom` R package.
    - The account its under.
    - Whether the account is a _user account_ or an _Org_.
- Together: Commit the changes.
- Your turn: Continue the exercise, and add more URL's:
    - The URL to your participation repo
    - The URL to your user page
- Together: Commit the changes.

### GitHub for collaboration

The "traditional" way to collaborate involves sending files over email. Problems:

- Easily lose track of who has the most recent version.
- Emails get buried.

Addressed by GitHub:

- GitHub repository treated as the "master version".
- Use [_GitHub Issues_](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) instead of email.

_Issues_ are a discussion board corresponding to a particular repository. One "thread" is called an Issue. Some features:

- Tag other GitHub users using `@username`.
- Get email notifications if you are tagged, or are `Watch`ing a repository.

As an example, check out the Issues in the [`ggplot2`](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) repository.

More on collaboration next Thursday.

### GitHub for collaboration - Activity 

__Together: `Watch`ing the `Announcements` repo__

- Navigate to the [Announcements](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-hw-2019-20/Announcements) repository.
- Click `Watch` on the upper-right corner of the repo

You should now get an email notification whenever an Issue is posted.

### GitHub for version control with git

GitHub uses a program called `git` to keep track of the project's history (more about `git` next Thursday).

- Users make "commits" to form a _commit history_.
- `git` only tracks the _changes_ associated with a commit, so it doesn't need to take a snapshot of all your files each time.
- The actual changes are called a _diff_.

Demostration:

- View commit history of the [STAT545-home](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-home) repository by clicking on the "commits" button on the repo home page.
- View a recent diff by clicking on the button with the _SHA_ or _hash_ code (something like `6c0a5f1`).
    - This is also useful for collaborators to see exactly what you changed.
- View the repository from a while back with the `<>` button.
- View the history of a file by clicking on the file, then clicking "History".

Why version control?

- Don't fret removing stuff
- Leave a breadcrumb trail for troubleshooting
- "Undo" and navigate a previous state
- Helps you define your work
- ...

### GitHub for version control with git - Activity 

__Your turn: History of the [`STAT545-UBC/Classroom`](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom) repository.__

- Use the commit history of the [`STAT545-UBC/Classroom`](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom) repository to find Assignment 01 that was delivered last year in STAT 545A (Note: the course ended in mid October 2018, and the assignments were held in a folder called `assignments`). 
- Add the URL of this assignment to your `navigating_github.md` file in your participation repository. Keep up with the commentary within the file, too. When was the assignment due? 

## Topic 3: Getting Help

- List 4 ways to get help in this course
- Activity: search stack exchange or other gh issues for examples. Reply to Issue in Announcements.


### Your turn: commenting on an Issue

Go to the Issues section of the [Announcements repository](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-hw-2019-20), and comment on the Issue I created called "Introduce yourself!". In the comment, say who you are, and greet the person above you -- be sure to tag them by their username using `@username`. 


## Wrap-up

Quiz:

- Examples of good and bad help questions
- Examples of approaches to get unstuck.
- Where to post a question/comment in STAT 545.
